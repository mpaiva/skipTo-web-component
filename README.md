# skipTo-web-component

A web-component extending the [SkipTo script](https://github.com/paypal/skipto) created by the PayPal Accessibility Team. This web-component creates a drop-down menu consisting of the links to important landmarks and headings on a given web page identified by the author.

This menu makes it easier for keyboard and screen reader users to quickly jump to the desired region of a page by simply choosing it from the list of options.

## Bonus
This web-component was created to be used with the U.S. [Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), as the Design Tokens are integrated as props for the web-components.
